# Pathfinding Algorithms in Hide and Seek Game

This project demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms through the development of a Hide and Seek game using Python and Pygame. The goal is to implement and visualize different pathfinding techniques within the game environment.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pygame**: Library used for game development and visualization.

## Features

- Implementation of different pathfinding algorithms.
- Integration of these algorithms into a Hide and Seek game.
- Visualization of pathfinding processes in real-time.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required libraries:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install pygame
